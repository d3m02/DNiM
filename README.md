# Dignostics and Information Modules (DnIM)  
### Set of portable implemntations for common diagnostic and information runtime modules:
+ Logger module 
+ Crash handler 

Currently repository in playground state. Idea is to train in developing common modules, experementing with different designs but maintaining portability for use as a submodule. Obviosuly, using as submodule will allow to scale such common instruments with different usecases, compilers and C++ standart versions, platform during working with other pet or sandbox projects.
